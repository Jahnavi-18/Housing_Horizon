# Housing_Horizon
This project involves housing classification using the "ParisHousingClass.csv" dataset. It starts with data exploration and preprocessing to handle missing values. A Decision Tree classifier with a max depth of 4 and entropy criterion is trained. The model is evaluated using a 70-30 train-test split, focusing on classification accuracy.
